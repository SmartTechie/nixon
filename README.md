# nixon
Theme for Hugo based on spf13.com

# Steve Francia's Website
Nixon is based on the theme from [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13.com). I've made changes for the sake of change (well, really just to customize it for my use).

## Steve's Notes

This is the source for http://spf13.com. I use [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com) to take the source here and create a static site which can be found at [spf13](http://spf13.com)
